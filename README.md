I am currently beginning my transition into cyber security and am focusing on building strong fundamentals through structured TryHackMe courses. My learning journey covers Pre-Security Pathway, Cyber Security 101, and SOC Level 1 (paused). I am documenting concepts, observations, and reflections to develop solid habits around security understanding and professional reporting.

## Objective

To build a strong foundation in cyber security and SOC operations, preparing for an entry-level SOC or Cyber Security Analyst role in the UK. My immediate focus is on completing foundational courses before resuming SOC Level 1 training.
